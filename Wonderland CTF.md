## TL;DR ‚Äî quick story
I found a Go web server and SSH open. A steganography clue in an image pointed me to a nested directory (`/r/a/b/b/i/t`) and to credentials for the `alice` user. From `alice` I abused a misconfigured `sudo` that runs a Python script as `rabbit`. By hijacking imports and PATH (creating `random.py` and a `date` binary) I escalated to `rabbit`, then to `hatter`, and finally used a capability-aware Perl trick to become `root` and capture the flags. üé©üîê

## Why I liked this room
This room is a nice mix of:
- Web & reconnaissance (hidden directories + steg)  
- SSH + credential discovery  
- Creative local privilege escalation via PATH/import hijacking  
- A final capability-based escalation (Perl)  

It‚Äôs great for practicing *thinking like the system* ‚Äî where scripts trust local files or assume safe PATHs.

## Recon & discovery

I started with a basic port scan and directory fuzzing.

- **Nmap** showed `22/tcp` (OpenSSH) and `80/tcp` (Go net/http server).  
- **Gobuster** discovered `/img`, `/r`, and `/poem`.  
- Inside `/img` I found images and used **StegSeek** ‚Äî one image revealed a `hint.txt` with the phrase `follow the r a b b i t`, which pointed me to `/r/a/b/b/i/t`.

That steg hint and the folder structure nudged me to check the site source more closely ‚Äî there I found a string that looked like credentials for `alice`.

## Initial access ‚Äî `alice`

I used the discovered credentials to SSH in:

```text
ssh alice@<TARGET-IP>
# password: HowDothTheLittleCrocodileImproveHisShiningTail
