My hands-on CTF writeups and scripts from TryHackMe, focused on learning offensive techniques and post-exploitation workflow.

## Contents
- `Publisher-CTF/` — writeup, commands, artifacts (example)
- `AnotherRoom/` — notes and scripts
- `tools/` — small scripts I wrote (sanitized)
- `LESSONS.md` — short reflections and what I’d do differently

> ⚠️ All work here is for educational use. Don’t try these techniques on systems you don’t own or have permission to test.
